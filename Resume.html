I like to read books and listen to music in my spare time, which relieves the pressure brought by my usual study, and can also learn knowledge that cannot be learned in books and broaden my horizons. Being active and making progress is my principle of doing things, humility and prudence are my strengths, and I know how to constantly improve and perfect myself from life and learning.
